# ECB-QE-Analysis

## Overview:

The project focuses on analyzing the European Central Bank's Quantitative Easing policies, particularly the Asset Purchase Programmes (APP) and the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programmes (PEPP). Over the past decade, these initiatives have significantly impacted Europe's financial landscape by stabilizing markets and supporting monetary policy. This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the largest asset purchases under each program, examining their scale, timing, and the types of assets involved. Our emphasis is on the presentation and visualization of these data points to ensure clarity in demonstrating the evolution of ECB holdings, both in terms of scale and asset types. Through detailed charts and visual summaries, we aim to enhance understanding of the ECBâ€™s QE strategies, facilitating better comparison between APP and PEPP performance across different time frames.
